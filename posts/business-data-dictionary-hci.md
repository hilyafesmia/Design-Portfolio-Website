It’s hard for data analyst to retrieve and update the data, hence resulting in slow analysis progress. From that problem, we decided to make a business data dictionary--data warehouse that is accessible for all stakeholders.'

## Goal
Help data analyst
- Search data definition
- Retrieve data definition
- Request update data definition

## Hypothesis
- Data analysts are not working closely with data engineers
- There are also stakeholders (other than data analyst and data engineer) that sometimes need to check the data warehouse

## Process

### Research
Contextual inquiry at HCI’s HQ, requirement gathering with stakeholders, user interview with 2 data analysts

### Key Findings
- Meeting is needed in order to make changes to a data definition. It consists of at least the person who requested a change, a data engineer and a representative from the department whose data definition to be changed. It can last for hours and doesn’t always result in solution, sometimes a second meeting is expected.
- Analysts don’t rely on data warehouse because it’s not updated regularly due to limitations mentioned above.

## Process

### Design
Built brand guideline (inc. design principles, naming&logo, UI kit), created information structure, wireframing, designed high-fidelity screens, conducted task-based usability testing with 4 people

### Solution
- Create additional comment and reply functionality on each data definition page to enable data analysts to discuss about the data definition remotely before making official request, eliminating physical meetings.
- Create additional notification functionality for users to notify them if they get mentioned in a discussion or if someone replied to their comment 
- Create additional News Page that consist of data definition update notes

## Lesson Learned
Dealing with clients is especially hard when they refer to you as a student and not a working partner. I have to learn how to stand my ground in times like this. A data-driven approach is most useful when dealing with stakeholders.
