## What is weton

**_TLDR; astrology made by Javanese people_**

In Javanese culture, weton is the calculation of your (or anyone's, basically) birthday based on the Javanese calendar and is used for decision-making and understanding of a person's characteristics. You can get your weton based on your Pasaran day or your birth month and year in Gregorian calendar.

Just like astrology, you can see a person’s deepest dark secret just by their weton. Also days to look forward to. Also days that bring bad luck. Also your compatibility with your partner. Practically anything–Javanese people use weton to predict everything.

## Why I made this

My great-great-great-grandma passed away on the first week of July 2022.

I was quite close with her as she lived with me during my elementary school days. She taught me a lot about Javanese culture; from the language, games, songs, folklore and not to mention weton.

She believed in weton, like, STRONGLY believed it. She said that my ma’s weton is X and my pa’s weton is Y so she approved of their marriage, otherwise I wouldn’t even be here. She also demonstrated her weton-counting skill to me and told me my weton right after I told her my birthday.

I didn’t really think about it that time, but now that she’s gone no one in the family knows how to count weton. Although I’m not a fan of astrology myself, let alone weton, I do think it’s necessary to preserve the tradition just for the sake of preserving them. So I made the weton counter bot.
