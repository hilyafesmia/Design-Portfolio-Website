## Why I made this

I like film photography. I like that I can't see the result right away. I like the feeling of _"Nyeh, let's just take a photo and get it over with"_ and _"I wonder how the photo will turn out"_ at the same time. Although I like the element of surprise, I still want to choose which film I should bring to enhance the mood of the event I want to take photos of. And this is where the problem begins.

I can search the film's name online, but the information people often provide is insufficient. I know I want to know the color profile of a BOEN Jakarta, but I also want to know what kind of camera I need to produce such a picture. At what time is this photo taken? Indoor or outdoor? Flash or no flash? Where do you develop your film? There are so many things that can affect a single photo, but the information is often not enough to conclude from.

I once tried buying an indie film because I liked the photos they showed on their Instagram profile. After I tried it, turns out the color cast was way more intense than I imagined. Not everything turns green, especially if your surroundings are red, like Chinatown. But for rural areas where I'm from, it feels like I'm in a black and green movie. Who knew the tint intensity could vary so much based on the surroundings? I wish I knew, but this information is, again, not provided anywhere.

That's why I made @macemfilm account. It's my way of experimenting with different films, cameras, and surroundings, documenting the details regarding the actual conditions. This serves as my own personal film encyclopedia, a place to recap past experiments and offer informed recommendations to friends seeking their desired "vibe" from film photography.
