## <a id="overview" style="position:relative;top:-200px"></a> Overview

Ristek Fasilkom UI is an independent organization operated by the students of the Faculty of Computer Science Universitas Indonesia (Fasilkom UI) that is aimed to cultivate students’ interests in the fields of science and technology.
In this project, we focused on redesigning one of Ristek Fasilkom UI’s products: SusunJadwal. The main goal is to redesign the app to make it more relevant to the current use cases.
As a result, the **number of created schedule during plan-prep periood reached an all-time high**.

### Users & Audience

Recurring users, Universitas Indonesia active students

### Roles and Responsibilities

Product Designer. This group project consisted of two other product designers, six engineers, and me.

## <a id="objective" style="position:relative;top:-120px"></a> Problem Statement

Academic registration is an activity where students choose classes they will take next semester. When planning their classes, students always have their considerations, including but not limited to taking the same classes as their peer group or avoiding morning classes at all costs. Because of this, students began to devise ways to prepare their class plans.

SusunJadwal was launched back in 2015 to help students prepare their class plans. The students received it well after its first launch.

**However, the enthusiasm didn’t stay for long; they stopped using it after the second or third academic registration.**

We assumed they left because it lacked the functionalities they needed when planning their studies.

After looking into the problem, questions came up to mind:

> Why did students stop using SusunJadwal?

> What made them switch?

> How might we help students to better plan their studies?

## Research

### Contextual Inquiries

#### Evaluating the current system

We tried to simulate the plan-making process using the current SusunJadwal system with seven tasks; login into the app, choose classes, remove classes from the plan, add external schedules, save a plan, and look at the existing plan.

#### User interview and task-based usability testing with six students

![UserInterview](/images/SusunJadwal/UserInterview.jpg "UserInterview")

We interviewed six students about things related to their plan-making habits but not limited to how they usually plan their classes and their consideration factors in choosing classes. We also conducted a task-based usability testing of the current system and observed how they navigate around it.

**Key Finding(s)**

- In a peer group, at least one person is responsible for plan making. The rest of the group will follow the plan to be together the whole semester.
- Students always have more than one plan. If things go wrong (e.g., the desired class has no quota left), they can switch to the second plan or sometimes a third plan if they’re unlucky.
- Other than classes, users also have non-academic routines (e.g., weekly organization meetings)
- Students use Google Sheet as their primary platform to make a class plan because it is accessible from the phone.
- All respondents don’t know a repository of their previously made plan exists. They think SusunJadwal can only save the last-made plan, so they screenshot the plan and keep it manually on their laptop.

## Design

### Branding

**Color Palette**

![ColorPalette](/images/SusunJadwal/ColorPalette.jpg "ColorPalette")

Ristek Fasilkom UI 2019’s primary color is turquoise. Hence, a turquoise color palette is a must for SusunJadwal. Additionally, we used yellow mustard as our secondary color and dark brown for the text.

### Wireframe

After the brainstorming session, we created the app's wireframes to show our solutions' general layouts.

#### Daftar Jadwal

![DaftarJadwal](/images/SusunJadwal/DaftarJadwal.gif "DaftarJadwal")

This is where all the plans students’ have made are stored, sorted from the most recently made to the oldest. Students can identify which plan is which by name or by the overview of the schedule. They can also share their schedule by clicking the copy button on the plan card.

#### Buat Jadwal

![BuatJadwal](/images/SusunJadwal/BuatJadwal.gif "BuatJadwal")

This is a snippet of how you can make a plan.

In the Jadwal Detail Page, we created a naming feature so students can determine which plan is which. The interaction is based on Google Sheet’s file naming feature because the students are familiar with it. We also added more rows until 9 PM (previously only until 6 PM) as student organization meetings often last until 9 PM.

### The number of created schedule during plan-prep periood reached an all-time high

We also introduced SusunJadwal to other faculties’ students.
