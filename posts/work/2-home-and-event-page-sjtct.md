## Overview
SejutaCita is a ticketing platform that allows students to create, share, and attend educational events to enrich their CVs. The events range from webinars, competitions, classes, scholarships, and more.
In this project, we focused on the Register to Event flow. The main goal is to restructure the information architecture in the app to improve the overall discovery-to-register flow.
As a result, the **Event Card CTR improved 3x** and the **Register Button CTR improved by 65%**.

### Users & Audience
First-time users, specifically in their first year of tertiary education.

### Roles and Responsibilities
Product Designer. My workflow includes creating a research plan, desk research, user interview, UI design, expert interviews, and testing. This project also involves tight collaboration between the CEO, Product Manager, Mobile Engineers, and me.

## Problem Statement

SejutaCita aims to democratize education by providing students a place where they can find events to boost their CV thus helping them getting better opportunities. **However, based on the data, users always stopped after either reaching the Home or Event page and didn’t continue to register for the event.** We assumed that users stopped because they didn’t know what to do in the app.

## Process Summary

![Flow](/images/SejutaCita/Flow.jpg "Flow")

## First Iteration

### Research

#### Existing System Analysis
As we assumed the users were confused, we evaluated the current flow using the 10 usability heuristic and UX laws mentioned on lawsofux.com.

### Design

### Testing

We interviewed 4 existing SejutaCita users about their daily routine and their SejutaCita app usage. We also conducted task-based A/B usability testing with them.

**Key Finding(s)**

- Respondents know what kind of event they want to partake. Most of them want to join a contest because if they win, it will boost their chance of getting admitted to university via SNMPTN (for secondary students) or getting scholarships (for tertiary education students).
- Respondents are usually busy students (e.g., joining an organization, participating in contests). So they always skim information on the Detail Event page.
- Less time is spent on the event-searching process using the proposed design because they can start from the category page instead of scrolling through all the events.
- Now respondents know where their event wishlist is stored. Before this, they keep their wishlist in their note app.

### Result
Register Button CTR on the Detail Event page improved. 

## Second Iteration

### Research

#### Expert Interview
We interviewed experts from unicorn e-commerce about the Register to Event flow.

**Key Finding(s)**

- Realize that different intention needs to be catered to accordingly:
    - Impulsive; window-shopping kind of user, come without buying intension.
    - Intentional; open the app to purchase a specific event.
- Home needs to give users enough context of what the app has to offer.
- Avoid endless scrolling.
- Make sure to track every CTA so we can determine which is good and which needs improvement.

### Design

### Testing

To confirm the proposed design, we conducted task-based A/B usability testing with 3 SejutaCita users and 3 persons who didn't know SejutaCita.

**Key Finding(s)**

- Those who don’t know SejutaCita use the search bar to look for events.
- Existing SejutaCita users need time to navigate the Home page as they can’t find the Event tab in the usual place. After they are familiar enough with the Home page, they have no problem navigating anywhere else.

Since we were aiming to acquire new users, we decided to roll with the proposed design.

### Result
Event Card CTR on the Explore (Event page) page improved. 

However, the number of users who reached the Event page decreased. We assumed that 1) existing users are still processing the change and 2) the Event button isn’t prominent enough.

## Third Iteration

### Design

### Testing

Because we are focusing on the existing users’ experience, we conducted task-based A/B usability testing with 5 existing SejutaCita users.

**Key Finding(s)**

The existing Event Button doesn’t look clickable because of the image beside it; it seems like a banner, not a button. The proposed design fixed that.

### Result
CTR of the Event button on the Home page improved.

## Final Result
### The Event Card CTR on the Home and Event page improved 3x (first vs. second iteration).
### The Register Button CTR on the Detail Event page improved by 65% (initial vs. first iteration).
